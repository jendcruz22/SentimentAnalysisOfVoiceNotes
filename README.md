# **Sentiment Analysis of VoiceNotes**

## **About:**
Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within data using several analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis and opinion mining have been acquiring a crucial role in both commercial and research applications because of their possible applicability to several different fields. For example in business : social media monitoring, customer support, brand monitoring, analysis of a customerâ€™s voice, market research and competitive research, etc. 

Although sentiment analysis has evolved over the past few decades, most of the work in it revolved around textual sentiment analysis with text mining techniques. Nevertheless, sentiment analysis on Audio data is also an extremely important field, as sentiment analysis on audio can be used to classify many different interactions between businesses and their customers/users. For example: Audio sentiment analysis can be used to classify the different types of calls that customer service centers receive for further analysis. It can also be used to classify other data such as audiobooks, podcasts, etc. 

Our system aims to make sentiment analysis on audio files available to the wider public by having it hosted on a cloud platform. The system will be using elements of cloud services such as transcription tools, etc. This method of deployment eliminates the need for an individual use to possess the necessary resources required to perform the analysis.
